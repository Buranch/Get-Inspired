   from now? How would you feel about yourself? How would you feel about
your life? Answering these questions will help you develop compelling reasons
  to achieve your goals. Having a powerful enough why will provide you with
 the necessary how. Take this opportunity to brainstorm your top four one-year
     goals. Under each one, write a paragraph about why you are absolutely
                committed to achieving these goals within the year.
